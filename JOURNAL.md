## 11/5/2025 - NEW design!  

So i actually went with the second idea that i had for the frame shape and i'm quite happy with it still need to make a few changes its too small in one of the directions but it is soo cool im loving it![Screenshot 2025-11-05 161019](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODY3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--03599e48495c6e449c574d7a2220ce0687241b29/Screenshot%202025-11-05%20161019.png)
